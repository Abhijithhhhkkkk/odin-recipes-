    <p><strong>Rice pudding</strong> is a creamy mixture of rice and milk that is cooked until it's thick and soft. It can be sweet or savory. This raisin-studded dessert rice pudding is thickened with an egg, sweetened with sugar, and enhanced with vanilla</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rice</strong>: This creamy rice pudding recipe starts with white rice cooked until tender.</li>

        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> The rice pudding is sweetened with white sugar</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavor of the other ingredients, but it won't make the pudding taste salty.</li>
